And now it’s even more versatile, with a larger 10.2‑inch Retina display, support for the full-size Smart Keyboard, and the amazing new capabilities of iPadOS. It’s unbelievably fun. And unmistakably iPad."},

You can easily edit a document while researching something on the web and making a FaceTime call to a colleague at the same time. Manage all your files in one convenient spot with the Files app and attach a full‑size Smart Keyboard for comfortable typing.1 And for tasks that require more precision, support for a trackpad or mouse complements the familiar Multi‑Touch experience of iPad."},

It feels as natural to use as a pencil, but with so much more capability."}
